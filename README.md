# JSrogue
A Javascript RogueLike / TTRPG inspired web-app. Turn based movement, long range combat and map editing!

**Update _(October 13th, 2025):_**
I used [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) to clean up redundancies, improve scalablity and ease of maintanance. As well as some assistance with adding new features.
The code going forward will be written by me with help from AI. 
I have created a new [branch for the old code](https://github.com/E-H-Q/JSrogue/tree/old)(https://github.com/E-H-Q/JSrogue/tree/old), which was *entirely* written by my human hands.
